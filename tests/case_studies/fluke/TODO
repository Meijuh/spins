- Reimplement the handling of mutexes.  They should be closely 
associated with thread objects.  Right now an extra one is
included, of each type, because of poor organization.

- Pass over the code looking for state reductions.

- The wait queue declaration is poor.  It should take
the number of threads (not twice the number of threads, as it
does now.) and declare two per thread.

- Cancel test still doesn't work.

- The web page should have more text in it (take stuff from the
docs.)
