Fluke IPC Verification
---------------------

This is an archive of the Flux Project's Promela sources used for
modeling Fluke's IPC path and using SPIN to check it out.  This
archive is much more of a snapshot of a project in motion, than a
distribution of a stable Promela implementation.  We are releasing it
in the hopes that some of the abstractions and approaches might be
useful; we don't expect anyone to do any rigorous testing of Fluke
with it.

NOTE:  We had to make a small change to SPIN to allow it to compile
and run our larger simulations.  This, and a longer list of our gripes
about Promela and SPIN are detailed in README.SPIN.

More information on Fluke, Flux, and this verification effort can be
found at http://www.cs.utah.edu/projects/flux. 

http://www.cs.utah.edu/~tullmann/flux/verify.html will take you
directly to the web page describing this work.

Documentation is minimal, though the code is pretty well commented.
But, CPP macros can only be taken so far...
