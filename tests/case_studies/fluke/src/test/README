Fluke IPC in Promela 
--------------------

This is the directory with the various tests of our system.  You will
need to have the hacks in the provided bin directory in your path
(sundry perl scripts that post-process various SPIN input and output.)

Most of the work is done in the make/testcase.mk file, this is included
by the Makefile in each subdirectory.   See make/testcase.mk for the
various variables you can set.  (e.g., 'make MODE=progress' will
run livelock tests)

If you've got some real big hardware and you run these tests, we'd be
very interested in the results.  (We got ours on a single-processor
200Mhz Pentium Pro with 256Mb of RAM.)
