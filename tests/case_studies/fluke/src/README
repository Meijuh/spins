Fluke IPC in Promela 
--------------------


This is the Promela source of our model of the Fluke IPC
implementation.  It is broken into two basic parts.  

The "control" directory contains basic translations of much of the IPC
path.  Think of this as a library of core functionality and of the
Fluke IPC implementation.  It is the control structure of the IPC path.
The code in this directory maps directly to the C code in Fluke.

The "fluke" directory contains models of various abstractions that the
control code relies on.  This directory contains abstractions that the
library relies on, and abstractions at the top level that call into
the library.  The code in this directory was developed independently
of the Fluke implementations (to take advantage of SPIN.)

Here's some simple, very rough, ASCII art depicting the situation.  In
order (top to bottom) of most abstract to most "concrete".

	Fluke.pr                 [ abstractions in /fluke ] 
	EntryPoint.pr
	
	-----------------------

	ipc*.pr sThread.pr       [ control path in /control ] 
	portsAndPsets.pr 
	cond.pr wait.pr 
	interrupts.pr dispatch.pr copyAround.pr 

	-----------------------

	Thread.pr
	Link.pr  Mutex.pr        [ abstractions in /fluke ]
	WaitQueue.pr 
	ResultCode.pr WaitVal.pr
	Status.pr 	


The "support" directory contains miscellaneous stuff that didn't fit
in either control or fluke.  Its mostly core abstractions that 
we use throughout the code that should be part of the language.

The "test" directory contains all of the test cases.

NOTE:  There are comments sprinkled throughout with "XXX".  These
are not particularly juicy revelations, but are things that need
some attention or should be fixed.
