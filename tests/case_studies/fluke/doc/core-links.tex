\subsection{Link Model}

Existing, usable IPC connections can be in two states: active, and
pickled.  Active connections are internally represented as a direct
pointer from on thread to another. (ie, {\tt client\verb\->\ipc_state.server}
is the address of the server's s_thread_t object).  Pickled connections
are represented as {\em links}.  One or the other is accurate, never
both (the non-active link is 0.)  A direct pointer can be
thought of as a 'cached' value of the link.

The kernel provides {\bf links} which represent 
inter-object references.  They are used for
encapsulating pointers and for reference counting.
Initially we will model
these as simply as possible; we may add
verification of the reference counting later.
