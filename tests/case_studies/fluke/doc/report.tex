\begin{abstract}
    We have formally described and modeled the reliable Interprocess 
    Communication (IPC) as implemented in the Fluke operating 
    system\cite{ford+:osdi96}. With this model we were able to verify
    certain properties, such as freedom of deadlock, under a number of
    test scenarios.  We have also provided a base of documentation and
    infrastructure for formal verification of other areas of Fluke.
    Our model tries to follow closely the actual C implementation
    of the IPC system, allowing us to make strong claims about 
    the actual system, as opposed to claims simply about the design.
