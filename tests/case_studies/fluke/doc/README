Fluke IPC in Promela
--------------------

A postscript version of the paper published in HOTOS-VI is available in
the papers subdirectory.

The doc directory doesn't contain the sort of documentation that
you're hoping for.  This is a collection of 3 documents, the original
project proposal, a status report half way through the project (that's
half-way through time wise, not results wise...), and a final project
report.  There is also an out-of-date, but still interesting/useful
simulation specification describing what we were planning to do in
Promela and how.

	Docs
	----

	proposal: The project proposal.

	progress: A progress report.

	ipc-outline:  A description of many of the C structures and
		functions used in Fluke IPC.  Probably too low-level
		for those that don't already understand the basics
		of Fluke IPC.  (Most everyone outside of the U. of
		Utah...)

	sim-spec:  A start at a specification detailing the
		way were planning to model Fluke in Promela.
		Quite divorced from reality now.

	report: Our "final" report on the project.

The Makefile should be able to crate any of the above by typing 
'make <name>.ps'
