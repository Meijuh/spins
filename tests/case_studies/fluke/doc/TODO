o need to prepare the NPM bibtex file somewhere

o thread_cancel in list of functions (at the top of Fluke.pr, and
	whereever in the doc.)

o list of functions/entrypoints -- a list of what entrypoints we
	model, perhaps how they're related, and a list of what
	functions we modeled?

o mutex section should desc. both flavors. (simple & safe), it should
	also explain that we abstracted spin_locks() [they're just
	a performance hack.]

o describe the idea of scaling the granularity with well-placed atomic/d_step
	blocks.

X the multiprocessor-ness of this simulation.  Ie that it is effectively
	one processor per thread.
	[DONE (sort of) in model-thread.tex]

o "Promela" is a proper noun; first letter should always be capitalized.

o our cool-ass tools (scripts, makefile, abstractions, etc.)

X the fact that the compile takes longer than the verification
	[DONE (sort of) in results.tex]

X describe failed experiment with separate thread state and control
	[DONE (sort of) in model-thread.tex]

o We also need to give a complete description of the thread state.. may be
	in one of the files on thread.  What mutexes.  What is actually
	from the code, and what we made up ourselves (I think only the
	rendevous bit and the ipc payload stuff.)

o describe the notion of our user-level driver programs also loosely(?)
called as test-cases.

o Courier-ize all ref's to d_step in-text

o Update the description of ports in portsEtc.tex

o Add the wait.c function descriptions to the appendix.

o Add the list of entrypoints to the appendix.

o intro is way out-of-date (paper structure forecast).

o We're still missing description of the large-scale structure of the
  besasie.  How about swapping 2&3, and adding a new 2?  Some other time?
