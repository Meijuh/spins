***************************************************************************

Remark: This directory and its supdirectory never contain slightly modified 
versions of the original GIOP model. The current version of the SPIN parser
does not tolerate the use of a variable called "pid", as it was used in the
original model and never claims. We have replaced this variable name 
consistently by the name "prid", both in the Promela models and the never 
claims. These are the only changes made to the models and never claims 
in this collection.
