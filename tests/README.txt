SpinJa - tests

This is the ./tests/ directory of SpinJa.
This directory contains two subdirectories with several Promela models
that have been used for testing and benchmarking SpinJa.

tests/beem
    Promela models from the BEEM database (http://anna.fi.muni.cz/models/) 
    which have been used to benchmark SpinJa. Results of these experiments
    can be found in Marc de Jonge's Master Thesis.

tests/sumo
    Additional Promela benchmark models. The SUMO language is a (small) 
    subset of the Promela language. The SUMO language has been used at 
    the Univerisity of Twente for teaching model checking techniques.
